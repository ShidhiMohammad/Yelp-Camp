# Yelp-Camp
This a project I used to practice demonstrating my web development skills. The website is a Yelp clone for campground locations around the world. It allows you to register as a new user and login to an existing account. Once logged in, you can comment on previous posts and leave a rating as well. You can also add your own campgrounds.

NodeJS & MongoDB were used in the backend, with HTML & CSS in the frontend.
