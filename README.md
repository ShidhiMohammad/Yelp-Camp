# Yelp-Camp
This a project I used to practice demonstarating my web development skills. This website can be accesed at https://enigmatic-springs-36875.herokuapp.com/. The website is essentially a Yelp clone for campground locations around the world. It allos you to register as a new user and login to an existing account. Once logged in, you are able to comment on previous posts and leave a rating as well. You can also add your own campgrounds.
